# Kristopher Kubicki 

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm Kristopher Kubicki, a software developer, entrepreneur, and radio enthusiast.✨ My projects range from smart home device types to cutting-edge data scraping tools, along with experimental ventures in audio processing, noise cancellation, and much more.  I’m always exploring new technologies and pushing the boundaries of software and hardware innovation.

## 📡 About Me 🍀

I also work at [OpenBrand.com](https://openbrand.com) (formerly [Gap Intelligence](https://www.gapintelligence.com), [Deep.ad](https://deep.ad), [Traqline](https://www.traqline.com), and Competitive Promotion Report). Check out our [GitHub](https://github.com/GapIntelligence) for job postings and more, including details on our open-source [DAR (Data Archive Request) format](https://github.com/GapIntelligence/DAR-Schema), a powerful tool for data collection and analysis similar to an HTTP archive request file.

I co-founded [Hubitat](https://hubitat.com), a smart home automation platform, and have developed numerous device types and integrations for Hubitat and SmartThings. Many of [my repos](https://github.com/KristopherKubicki?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=groovy&sort=) contain device types and apps useful for both platforms. 

## Recent Projects

### [Glimpser](https://github.com/KristopherKubicki/glimpser) 🌅
[Glimpser](https://glimpser.net) is my time series NVR (Network Video Recorder) designed for enthusiasts who want to capture, analyze, and visualize changes over time. It's for anyone fascinated by visualizing data across different time intervals.

### Artdrop 

Artdrop is an automated art-purchasing bot. 🌌  It is a highly automated workflow for monitoring, alerting and acquiring art that is ships and sold on the internet.  You can see a public feed of the sfotware at [Drops.art](https://drops.art/). 

### [CostCrawler](https://github.com/KristopherKubicki/CostCrawler)
CostCrawler is a public project built to crawl hospital pricing data, unify pricing codes, and bring transparency to healthcare costs.  It's part of my ongoing effort to disintermediate data landscapes through automation.  You can see how this is implemented at [Waymed.com](https://waymed.com/).

### More Projects
While many of my projects are public, I also have a range of private repositories focused on web crawling, [drones](https://github.com/KristopherKubicki/ceilinator), and radio frequency applications that I don’t share publicly. If you're interested in any of these areas, feel free to reach out—I’m always eager to discuss cool tech. 🌱

Also, check out some early work I did on building multi-modal recognition pipelines for [all kinds of media types](https://github.com/KristopherKubicki/video2data).
